def maximumDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a=[]
        diff=-1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i,len(nums)):
                if(i<j and nums[i]<nums[j]):
                    diff=max(nums[j]-nums[i],diff)
        return(diff)
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Example 1:

Input: nums = [7,1,5,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The maximum difference occurs with i = 1 and j = 2, nums[j] - nums[i] = 5 - 1 = 4.
Note that with i = 1 and j = 0, the difference nums[j] - nums[i] = 7 - 1 = 6, but i > j, so it is not valid.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [9,4,3,2]
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no i and j such that i < j and nums[i] < nums[j].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,5,2,10]
Output: 9
Explanation:
The maximum difference occurs with i = 0 and j = 3, nums[j] - nums[i] = 10 - 1 = 9.
