def checkString(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s=list(s)
        a=sorted(s)
        if(a==s):
            return True
        else:
            return False
            
            
            
            
            
 Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabbb"
Output: true
Explanation:
The 'a's are at indices 0, 1, and 2, while the 'b's are at indices 3, 4, and 5.
Hence, every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return true.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abab"
Output: false
Explanation:
There is an 'a' at index 2 and a 'b' at index 1.
Hence, not every 'a' appears before every 'b' and we return false.
