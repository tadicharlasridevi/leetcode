def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        a=sorted(target)
        b=sorted(arr)
        if(a==b):
            return True
        return False
        
        
        
        
        Example 1:

Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.
Example 2:

Input: target = [7], arr = [7]
Output: true
Explanation: arr is equal to target without any reverses.
Example 3:

Input: target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: arr does not have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.
