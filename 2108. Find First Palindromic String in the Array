1)class Solution:
    def firstPalindrome(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        return next((word for word in words if(word)==word[::-1]),"")
        
        
        
        Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
         Output: "ada"
        Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
         Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
