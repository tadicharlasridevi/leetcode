def maxSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        while(k<len(nums)):
            nums.remove(min(nums))
        return nums
        
        
        
        
        
        Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
Output: [3,3]
Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
Output: [-1,3,4]
Explanation: 
The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].
