def capitalizeTitle(self, s: str) -> str:
        a=""
        for i in s.split():
            if(len(i)<=2):
                i=(i.lower())
                a=a+i+" "
            else: 
                i=i.capitalize()
                a=a+i+" "

        Example 1:

Input: title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe"
Output: "Capitalize The Title"
Explanation:
Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.
Example 2:

Input: title = "First leTTeR of EACH Word"
Output: "First Letter of Each Word"
Explanation:
The word "of" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.
Example 3:

Input: title = "i lOve leetcode"
Output: "i Love Leetcode"
Explanation:
The word "i" has length 1, so it is lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.
