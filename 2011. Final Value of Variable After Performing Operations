def finalValueAfterOperations(self, n: List[str]) -> int:
        a=[]
        for i in n:
            if(i=="--X" or i=="X--"):
                a.append(0-1)
            elif(i=="X++" or i=="++X"):
                a.append(0+1)
        return(sum(a[:]))
        
        
        
        
        ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.


Example 1:

Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
Example 2:

Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
