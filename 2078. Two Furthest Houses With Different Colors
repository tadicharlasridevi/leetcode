def maxDistance(self, colors: List[int]) -> int:
        m=0
        for i in range(0,len(colors)):
            for j in range(len(colors)-1,0,-1):
                if colors[i]!=colors[j] and j>i:
                    m=max(m,j-i)
        return m
        
        
        
        
        
        Example 1:


Input: colors = [1,1,1,6,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, and color 6 is red.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 3.
House 0 has color 1, and house 3 has color 6. The distance between them is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
Note that houses 3 and 6 can also produce the optimal answer.
Example 2:


Input: colors = [1,8,3,8,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: In the above image, color 1 is blue, color 8 is yellow, and color 3 is green.
The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 4.
House 0 has color 1, and house 4 has color 3. The distance between them is abs(0 - 4) = 4.
Example 3:

Input: colors = [0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 and house 1.
House 0 has color 0, and house 1 has color 1. The distance between them is abs(0 - 1) = 1.
